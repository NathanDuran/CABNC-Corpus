PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|I was thinking perhaps they'd bring them back So Thursday we we usually come out of Bridge Street go round the corner and then down to the end of the car's parked at the end of the lane So I said wonder if they've got that headboard for Ken you know I didn't know he had one I said we'll have a look and see how much they are When we got there it's all locked up Oh that's for stocktaking they said And we looked through the side windows and there's not a thing on the ruddy counters it's cleared out There's nothing there at all so there's no stock they can sell they've shut down I expect.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|And the week before it was all Christmas stuff was still in there.
PS0F5|Oh you know in you know in Ponty You know that great big double shop that's a mini market They always got chairs and wicker baskets and things.

PS0F7|Well I gave him two when he stayed here to stay er to hang er on his door and he.
PS0F5|and I'm not kidding you he's got his blue coat that he wears down the garden you know the one with all the he's got erm his army jacket a grey jacket erm tt how many has he got I think there's another jacket that he's got and there's no room to keep them all downstairs on the hook hanging in the passage.

PS0F7|I know I they haven't been open all this week.
PS0F5|I've been I was thinking today actually when I was walking up the road and I thought oh the is shut again They're gon na close down aren't they.
PS0F7|I think so.
PS0F5|I think I think that last erm break in has done it to death hasn't it.
PS0F7|Er they've still got a Father Christmas outfit in there er er in one window the one next to the shop.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|But I've been up the road every day this week not shopping but just out for a walk you know If I can get out.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|but most days but erm and the bar's right across the door and last week when I went out they still had er er one or two bits of Christmas stuff in the one window and some balls of er in there.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|But that window's completely cleared out now and it hasn't been open at all this week.
PS0F5|No.
PS0F7|Betty says a window in Caerphilly had been knocked in.
PS0F5|Oh yeah.
PS0F7|There's a board up to that And where is the other one I saw.
PS0F7|The wine store up the top end there they.
PS0F5|Aye that's right They've got erm.
PS0F7|They've got a big piece of wood.
PS0F5|they've got a board yeah.
PS0F7|Yeah a board up their window.
PS0F5|Yeah that's right.
PS0F6|I did twelve.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|But you know it surprises me I mean I know the church is is closed and it's been closed for a couple of years now and it looks a sight because now I don't know how many members they've got at least a couple of them could go in there and cut all the brambles down.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|I mean if you belong to a church you do something to make it look tidy don't you I mean that church isn't in such a bad state bloody fall on you all the time You go past there and you look in that front and people have been dumping bags of rubbish over there.
PS0F5|Yeah they will.
PS0F7|Little tiny white bags full with cans and odd just dump I mean there's no respect at all lately is there You wouldn't think of doing it years ago.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|even if the church was And they've cut all the side the other side Church Street they've cut all the hedge of the church down there and dumped all the grass inside no not the grass the branches inside well you'd think they'd get a blooming lorry or a van to take it all down the blooming tip wouldn't you.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|To ta just to make it look a bit respectable because it's a church they're using that part of it.
PS0F5|Yeah.
PS0F7|absolutely terrible I said to.
PS0F6|Nan.
PS0F7|about it the other day aye he says but they weren't supposed to cut anything down he said they were only supposed to cut a bit off the top Well I said that doesn't excuse the thing of of tipping all over and putting it inside and not shifting it It looks terrible.
PS0F6|Nan which church.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F6|was the bit that's sticking out on the path.
PS0F5|Yes.
PS0F7|No somebody could go in there who belonged to the church anyway two or three of them and it wouldn't take long cutting all those brambles and things away.
PS0F6|Tt nan do you mean the Cubs' church.
PS0F7|Yes.
PS0F6|Cos then they usually make fires.
PS0F7|Well I I don't know what's stopping some of the they'll go up one day er there one day and they'll.
PS0F6|Why can't they leave.
PS0F7|throw something over it would be up.
PS0F6|Nan why can't they leave just a little patch of grass for the fire.
PS0F7|I said to Di if you want pea sticks that's the place to go because they've got and he said oh I go now But er you'd think they'd get a lorry or something to shift it from there.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|It's a fire hazard really isn't it You know with kids today And I tell you another thing I noticed I cut through the car park in the lane behind Shirley's one day this week I went through and and the back door of the old police station's open And all the windows in the back are broken.
PS0F5|Mm.
PS0F7|So I expect somebody's been and er the er the door thing you can get in the back way and in through the back door I bet there's some people sleeping in there in the night.
PS0F6|Someone could easily make a fire in there.
PS0F7|I mean if they're not gon na use the building and they can't sell it gut it Cos they said they were gon na sell it then they changed their mind they were gon na pull it down.
PS0F6|If they can't sell it pull it down and put something else in.
PS0F7|It's no good is it now.
PS0F6|Put something else in like a flat.
PS0F7|Shouldn't think it's very nice inside There's room for flats I think.
PS0F6|Mm.
PS0F7|Even on the ground floor.
PS0F5|There was.
PS0F6|Nan Ah ah Is that all you've got on the line one tea towel.
PS0F7|Well that's not a tea towel there nanny cleaned her windows yesterday and er when I I'd wiped er with a cleaning off I washed it up again and I put it out yesterday and I keep forgetting to bring it in.
PS0F5|Tt well if somebody's desperate that they want to pinch that they're quite welcome to it.
